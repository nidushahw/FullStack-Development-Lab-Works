                <p>Some of us simply can't stand to be in one place for too long —
                     we are drawn to 
                     <strong>new experiences, cultures, and people,</strong>
                      and we feel a constant to pull to.

                     I often talk about how strange life can be. Who decides who has access to opportunity and how were we so lucky to be born where we were born?
                     As a couple of middle class Canadians, we have always had a comfortable and privileged standard of living.
                     Even if we weren’t considered rich in our own country, we could enjoy the luxuries of life. 
                     There was always food, clean water, air conditioning and heat, and of course opportunities and freedom to travel. 
                     It was those opportunities to travel that helped shaped who we are today.
